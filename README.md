# Exploratory Analysis of Flight Price



Welcome to the "Exploratory Analysis of Flight Price" project repository. In this project, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a flight price dataset to uncover insights and trends related to airfare. The primary goal is to gain a better understanding of the factors influencing flight prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and is named `flight_price.xlsx`. It contains detailed information about flight prices, including attributes such as airline, source, destination, departure time, duration, stops, and more.


## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/exploratory-analysis-of-flight-price.git


1. Navigate to the project folder:

      cd exploratory-analysis-of-flight-price

3. Install the required Python packages:

      pip install -r requirements.txt


Exploratory Data Analysis
The Jupyter Notebook Exploratory_Analysis_Flight_Price.ipynb contains the EDA process, where we explore the dataset's structure, visualize key features, and analyze relationships between variables. The notebook provides insights into flight pricing trends and patterns.

Results and Insights
The EDA process has uncovered valuable insights into the flight price dataset, highlighting trends, correlations, and potential influencing factors. Key findings and visualizations are presented in the Exploratory_Analysis_Flight_Price.ipynb notebook.
